Consider the following scenario where we have 2 entities in our system.

1. User

2. Client



 

We have the number of users registered in our system.

You can use Djangoâ€™s default admin template to create/register users but not other entities or you can make REST APIs for users as well if you want.

 

You have to perform the following tasks :

1. Register a client

2. Fetch clients info

3. Edit/Delete client info
